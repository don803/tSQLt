## Overview
tSQLt.RunAll executes all tests in all test classes created with tSQLt.NewTestClass in the current database. If the test class schema contains a stored procedure called SetUp, it is executed before calling each test case. The name of each test case stored procedure must begin with ‘test’. RunAll displays a test case summary. By default, the test case summary is a text based table. However, the result format can be changed using the stored procedure, SetTestResultFormatter.
